        <p>I’m a designer who challenges hard to develop my senses and abilities. I majored in industrial design in Korea, and I became interested in visual design from Level 3. In addition, in Level 4, I worked as a researcher in the corporate identity research team with my professor on local government Brand identity. It developed logos and characters using drawings and digitizing that fit the characteristics of the region and produced basic style guides and application style guides after the clients confirm.</p>
        <p>After graduation, I was in charge of quality control and product design at Yejin Metal for 5 years. It was a metal processing company that mainly produces lipstick, perfume, and caps from metal.  After that, I became interested in web design and editorial design, and while learning about web design at a vocational school for a year, I obtained various certificates such as web design technicians, visual design engineers, and multimedia experts. After that, I worked in design at a web design company. I had to quit the company for child care because I got pregnant. When I tried to get a job again, I’ve got some problem which is about reactive Web Design. In the past, I mainly used a table to design the web. After that, I tried hard to learn responsive web design online, but I couldn’t easily learn it.</p>
        <p>When I came to Canada, I wanted to learn more about reactive web design, so I enrolled in the interactive multi-media design at Fanshawe. In addition to learning html5 and CSS, and other skills such as Cinema 4d, Premiere, After Effects, etc. Although it was not easy to study, I am satisfied that I can learn many skills systematically. Therefore, I am sure that I am the passionate and talented designer your company is looking for.</p>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time for me even though you are busy. I would be happier if you reply. If you have any questions about me, please call or email me.</p>
